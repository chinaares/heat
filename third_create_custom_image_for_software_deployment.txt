##it also requires the command  jq  to be present inside the image, it's a good exerciste to troubleshot heat stack, so it would be :

diskimage-builder/bin/disk-image-create vm $BASE_ELEMENTS $AGENT_ELEMENTS      $DEPLOYMENT_BASE_ELEMENTS $DEPLOYMENT_TOOL -o $IMAGE_NAME.qcow2 -p jq

where -p specifies the packages to intall comma separated

seems that there is no jq package for centos7 and no idea how to add it with disk image builder... switching to RHEL
i have to change centos7 on BASE_ELEMENST for rhel7  how to regiter the the image to cust portal is explsined /home/ebarrera/virtualization/vm/isos/diskimage-builder/elements/rhel-common

The cloud image can be found at (login required):
https://access.redhat.com/downloads/content/69/ver=/rhel---7/7.1/x86_64/product-downloads

Then before running the image build, define DIB_LOCAL_IMAGE (replace the file
name with the one downloaded, if it differs from the example)::
  export DIB_LOCAL_IMAGE=rhel-guest-image-7.2-20160302.0.x86_64.qcow2

The downloaded file will then be used as the basis for any subsequent image
builds.

For further details about building RHEL 7 images, see the rhel-common and
redhat-common element README files.

To specify configuration as puppet manifests the heat-config-puppet element is required to be on the built image, so Custom image script needs to be modified with the following:

export DEPLOYMENT_TOOL="heat-config-puppet"
